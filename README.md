# Linear-Regression-using-Python
This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression using the scikit-learn library. It performs linear regression on a dataset consisting of input variables (x) and multiple output variables (y1, y2, y3, y4). The code also includes functionality for handling and preprocessing training and test data, selecting ideal functions based on the sum of squared deviations, mapping test data to the selected ideal functions, saving the data to a SQLite database, and visualizing the results using the Bokeh library.
